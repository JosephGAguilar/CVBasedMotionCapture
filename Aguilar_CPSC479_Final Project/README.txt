To run this program, move into the Source Code folder. Place the video you would like to generate motion capture for (or use the provided input video input_video.mp4) then name it input_video.mp4. Then, type "python CPSC479-Final.py --gpu n" into your terminal/console to run the program on your CPU. If you'd like to use GPUs, you can instead type "python CPSC479-Final.py --gpu 0" or "python CPSC479-Final.py --gpu 0,1" to utilize your GPU, id'd 0, or two GPUs, id'd 0 and 1.

(I apologize for the inconvenience, it would not let me create an executable for this program.)

In addition, there is a Juptyr notebook "CPSC479-Final.ipynb" that allows you to walk through each function and each neural network that is a part of the process piece by piece. Outputs from this notebook from when I ran through it can be found in the "Intermediary Output" folder.

You can view the outputs I achieved with this code as well as the videos that were used as input in the "Output Videos" and "Input Videos" respectively.
